Library Management System for Stepwise University

Submitted by: Evan Balson
### Time spent: 21 days

## Description:
The Library Management System for Stepwise University is a C++ program designed to efficiently manage an imaginative university library's operations. It facilitates tasks such as:
* [x] Book Registration
* [x] Borrowing Books
* [x] Return Books
* [x] Fine Calculation
* [x] Catering to both students and librarians users.
* [x] Read and write from files (Txt/Csv)
* [x] registering, update and delete system users functions
* [x] registering, update and delete system book functions
* [ ] search for:  available books, fines, borrowing record, and return record.
* [x] Record tansactions and print receipts

# 1. TECHNOLOGIES USED:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
## .NET Framework

## WinForms

## Microsoft Visual Studio

## iostream:
	This header file provides functionality for input and output 	streams in C++.
	It includes classes like cin and cout for standard 	input and output operations.

## string:
	This header file provides functionality for working with strings 	in C++.
	It includes the string class for string manipulation 	operations.

## unordered_map:
	This header file provides an implementation of an 	associative container that stores
	elements formed by the 	combination of a key and a mapped value. It allows for fast 
	retrieval of values based on keys.

## vector:
	This header file provides an implementation of a dynamic array. 
	Vectors are useful for storing sequences of elements that can grow 	or shrink in size.

## iomanip:
	This header file provides functions and manipulators to 
	manipulate input and output formatting, such as setting field 	width and precision.

## cctype:
	This header file provides functions for character handling in C++,
		including functions for checking whether characters are 	alphabetic, numeric, or alphanumeric.

## locale:
	This header file provides facilities for handling locale-specific 	information,
	such as character classification and formatting 	conventions.

## ctime:
	This header file provides functions for working with date and time 	information in C++,
	including functions for getting the current 	system time.

## sstream:
	This header file provides facilities for working with string 	streams,allowing you to treat strings as input/output streams.
	algorithm: This header file provides a collection of functions for 	performing common algorithms and operations on sequences, such as 	sorting and searching.

## fstream:
	This header file provides classes for working with files in C++, 
	including classes for reading from and writing to files.

## regex:
	This header file provides facilities for working with regular 	expressions in C++,
	allowing you to search for patterns within 	strings.

## windows.h:
	This header file is specific to Windows and provides functions and 	macros for working with the Windows API. 
	In this case, it's used 	to launch a file into an open window.

## classes:
	Classes are a fundamental feature of object-oriented programming 	(OOP) in C++. 
	They allow you to encapsulate data and behavior into 	objects, promoting modularity and code reuse.

## encapsulation:
	Encapsulation is a principle of OOP that involves bundling data 	and methods that operate on the data into a single unit (i.e., a 	class). It helps to hide the internal state of an object and 	restrict access to it from outside the class.

## EOF Handling:
	EOF (End-of-File) handling refers to the process of detecting when 	the end of an input stream has been reached. This is commonly done 	using functions like cin.eof() in C++.

## Exception Handling:
	Exception handling is a mechanism in C++ for dealing with errors 	and other exceptional conditions that occur during program 	execution. It allows you to handle errors gracefully and recover 	from them without crashing the program.

# 2. REQUIREMENTS:
------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Windows operating system

## Microsoft Visual Studio (for development)

## .NET Framework installed

## Operating System:

	Windows 10 version 1507 or higher. Visual Studio 2022 doesn't 	support Windows 7 or Windows 8.1.

## Processor:
	1.8 GHz or faster processor. Multi-core or better recommended for 	optimal performance.

## Memory (RAM):
	Minimum: 4 GB RAM (8 GB recommended).
	
## Hard Disk Space:
	Visual Studio requires a minimum of 13 GB of available hard disk 	space for a typical installation, but this can vary based on the 	features you choose to install.

	Additional disk space might be required for temporary files and 	other dependencies.

## Graphics:
	A minimum display resolution of 1366 x 768 is recommended.
